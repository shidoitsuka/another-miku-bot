### About
> This is the remake of my first [miku-bot](https://github.com/shidoitsuka/miku-bot).

Miku is one of discord bot written using [discord.js](https://www.discord.js.org) library.
This bot is a just4fun bot, which does not meant to do administrator-side stuffs. However I will add administrator commands to Miku in future because sometimes it is important to have it on your bot.

### What can this bot do?
- Fun stuffs
- Give you quotes
- Makes you laugh
- Gives you the power of the *Magic 8 Ball*
- Much much more in future!

### Usage & Modules

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run the bot.
Please install *windows-build-tools* if you are using windows in order to run canvas commands.

Head to the bot directory and then simply run
```sh
$ npm i -S
# if you are using windows run this command as well, else just skip
$ npm i -S windows-build-tools
# and then
$ node index.js
```
And you are good to go!
